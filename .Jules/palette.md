## 2026-01-22 - Custom Dialog Accessibility
**Learning:** The project uses a custom `Dialog` implementation (`frontend/src/components/atoms/dialog.tsx`) that ignores the installed `@radix-ui/react-dialog` primitives. This custom implementation was missing critical accessibility attributes like `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-label` on the close button.
**Action:** When working with "atoms" in this codebase, always inspect the implementation to check if it's wrapping a headless library or doing it manually. For manual implementations, manually add ARIA attributes. Specifically for Dialogs, ensure `role`, `aria-modal`, and labelled close buttons are present.
