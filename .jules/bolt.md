## 2026-01-14 - SprintsService N+1 Optimization
**Learning:** The "fix-on-read" pattern (fixing data consistency in a getter like `findAll`) is a dangerous anti-pattern that causes massive N+1 issues. In this case, `SprintsService.findAll` was re-fetching and updating task counts for every sprint on every read, resulting in O(N) database writes for a simple list view.
**Action:** Rely on event-driven updates (updating counts when tasks are modified) instead of fixing on read. If consistency is critical, use a `GROUP BY` query to compute aggregates on the fly rather than iterating and updating entities. Also, always prefer `count()` queries over loading entities into memory just to check `length`.
